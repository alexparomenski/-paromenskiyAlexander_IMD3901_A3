• Overview of what you did (i.e. what are the controls? Why this design?)
	
I created two game modes. In one you must collaborate with another player to reach the other side of the room, while the competetive mode
you will be testing your accuracy to see who can net more points in a shooting range (first one to 3 points wins). 

Collaborative controls: 
Just click or touch on your phone where you want to move or press. The reasons why I made these control so simple is because I wanted to include
people who would like to play this on their phone or Ipad. All the movements could be done by touching the screen. 

Collaborative how to beat it: 
One player must stand on the yellow button to hold the door open, more navigation areas would be unlocked and the other player must get over to the other side
However, the other player can't get out, unless the player on the other side presses the red button to remove the door. Hooray you passed!!!

Competetive controls: 
Press the purple button to spawn a ball, to pick up the ball simple press on it and you will see it stuck to your hands. To throw the ball press space. 
This mode is strictly for PC. 

Competetive how to win: 
First person to score 3 points wins, once you hit a target it will turn green and you CANNOT get points for it again so only aim for the ones that are red!!!


• What was challenging.

I had some difficulties with sockets and trying to understand how i can use them in a game. I also underestimated the scope of this assignment. I started it 
3 days before the due date, but I needed much more time to get my ideas going :), Thank you for allowing the extension it really helped! :). 

Also after writing a bunch of code and having various javascript files connected to various objects it started to become more difficult to troubleshoot
if something went wrong. Because everything is connected and quite complex it took awhile to figure out what was causing the issue, but with console.log statements
and tracking the program and just seeing how everything worked together with sockets, I was able to solve many problems!

• What went well (i.e. how did you solve the above challenges?).
With time I was able to solve many problems. If something was not working, I would try to see how to fix it. 
However, somethings would just not work and I solved those issues by approaching the problem in a different way and rewriting my logic. 

I'm very happy with this project, I added many sound effects and music to give more feedback to users. Which was an issue with my last assignment. I 
really hope you like it and I'm looking forward to hearing your feedback! :) I also want to say I learned so much by doing this project and it was so much fun, 
the only frustrating bits were when I couldn't figure out what wasn't working, but even then it felt so nice figuring out the root of the problem and solving it.
